== Description ==

Terminal IDE is a command line java / android dev kit that runs on the device itself.

Using a correctly configured vim, bash and busybox, in a custom terminal + custom keyboard environment.

All these applications are put together so that they interact correctly.

A full Terminal emulator + custom ANSI keyboard ensure good bash, vim and busybox emulation.

All set up and ready to run in a NON-ROOT environment. Normal user permissions are enough to run all of this.

==Installation==

If you are looking just for installation and not the code, just copy the .apk file provided, and run it in your Android device.
